# SleepTracker

SleepTracker is a simple, web-based application where the user can log and track the amount of sleep they had over the day. This project was made to learn the basics of backend development and how the frontend and backend parts work together in a web application.

This application was developed under guidance and focuses on learning the core concepts, not providing advanced features.

Features

- Log sleep duration daily
- View the previously entered sleep records
Simple and clean user interface
Backend-powered data handling

- Beginner-friendly project structure

---

Tech Stack
Python – Core programming language

- **Flask** – backend web framework

- **HTML/CSS** - Front-end structure and styling

This project uses a minimal setup to focus on backend fundamentals.

## How It Works
1. User provides sleep-related information via a web form.
2. The frontend sends the data to the Flask backend.

3. Flask routes receive and process the request.

4. The app stores and retrieves sleep records.

5. The processed data is displayed back to the user.

It showcases a simple client-server interaction through HTTP requests.

Use Case

SleepTracker can be used to

A simple, personal sleep logging tool

A beginner backend practice project
- A demonstration of Flask routing and form handling
The vehicle's control characteristics are essentially nonlinear.
